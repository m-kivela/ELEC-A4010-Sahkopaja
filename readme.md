# Keijo (Kalevi) Kriipperi

Keijo is the belowed Creeper character from the popular video game Minecraft. Keijo uses its onboard camera and an image detection algorithm to recognize people from its surroundings and chase after them, just like in the game!

## Aalto University ELEC-A4010-Sähköpaja -project

These are some of the project files for our 4 member team project at Aalto University introductory workshop. Apart from the Aalto Wiki -article (which was written by all 4 of us), these are my contribution to the project.

My responsibility was the mechanical and electric design, and most of the fabrication. As such, this repository mostly just includes just the Solidworks CAD files, a wiring diagram and photos of the end result.

Read `Wiki_article_Keijo_Kriipperi.pdf` for a more detailed overview of the entire project! (also, excuse me for the poorly formatted Wiki-article, the Aalto Wiki pdf conversion tool breaks the formatting, and the Wiki itself is only accessible to those with Aalto University login)
